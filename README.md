Flappyranha is a continuous scrolling video game that uses very simple eighties-style graphics; it is clearly inspired to the famous Flappy Bird, released a few years ago.

The goal is to score as high as possible by flying this strange fish through a series of pipes, while avoiding colliding with them or dropping to the ground. The piranha, also, can collect floating flash on the screen to let the player increase the score!

Our nice friend is very sensitive to movements, which is why the game is quite difficult and challenging.
